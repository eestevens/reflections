I already pretty much know the point.  it makes it way easier to find differences in files

having easy access to old versions can make you a better programmer by making it easier to track issues that appear.  Additionally, with more checkpoints, you can work faster

with manual commits, every commit is meaningful and should be functional

Multi File Commits
With Git, it’s expected that commits should span multiple files.  Code is going to be dependent on other files, so we’d need to be able to track those dependencies and changes.  

With something like Google Docs, on the other hand, it’s intended to be used as a word processor, where one document shouldn’t have a lot of impact on any other documents.
